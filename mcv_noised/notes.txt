How to consider the domain for string type attributes:
1. Try to infer the format
________

1. Try to find queries that do not have attributes with complicated domains
2. Slightly less complex domain: ('title', 'phonetic code') : Letter followed by a number picked from a range
- might need to check the range of numbers
3. Need to use a sketch or sampling - in order to represent the domain (in a compact form) without the combinatorial blow-up

____________

4. TODOs:
a. Need to study how to do sampling and the privacy guarantees
b. Try to manually infer format for some of the string.
c. Also study differentially private sketches
d. Read Saqe (Bater et al) again


5. Remember to count the null values and their counts as well.

6. Can write it with Regex (can be used for uder-provided domain information).
