Q. What is the corresponding values of staop and stacol when some stakind is 3 (meaning there is a correl)?
Both staop and stacol have different int values that comes from postgres internals. Will consider these public.
StavaluesN is always null if there is a correl for that stakindN.

Q. Understanding DP noise addition: Am I spending some privacy budget at each draw from the Laplace distribution?
If the data is disjoint, then the epsilon is not additive. It is not disjoint then 0.1 is divided among the different values noised.
Question is, is our data disjoint or not? What does data being disjoint mean? How do you show whether some data is disjoint or not?

Last time:
Added noise to just null_frac, fresh noise 10 different times and took average runtime of 10 runs for each iteration or noise addition.
Plotted the bars.

Plan:
Need to run all queries at some point, and also run them with oblivious and DP stats with timeout 2x original runtime.

Today's Task:
Find a query to enumerate plans for:

- Pick 6a because the difference between obl and pub is big 
and dp runtime frac is smaller than both obl and pub.

SELECT MIN(k.keyword) AS movie_keyword, MIN(n.name) AS actor_name, 
MIN(t.title) AS marvel_movie 
FROM cast_info AS ci, keyword AS k, movie_keyword AS mk, name AS n, title AS t 
WHERE k.keyword = 'marvel-cinematic-universe' AND n.name LIKE '%Downey%Robert%' 
AND t.production_year > 2010 AND k.id = mk.keyword_id AND t.id = mk.movie_id 
AND t.id = ci.movie_id AND ci.movie_id = mk.movie_id AND n.id = ci.person_id;

Task: Organizing PrivOpt Github repository
- Files used for experiments:
1. erase.py 
2. run_given_qs.py
3. run_noisy.py
-Files used to analysis or look into things
1. clean_plans.py
2. plot_bars.py
3. print_query_names.py

Makes three directories potentially:
1. experiment code 
2. utility code
3. throwaway code

Also push runtime Files
Push plan files for a few interesting queries

Task 2: Plan to run the rest of the queries - write bash code for this maybe
